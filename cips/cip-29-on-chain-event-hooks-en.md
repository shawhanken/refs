# On-chain Event Hooks Proposal

## 1. Motivation

### 1.1 The Gap

In Ethereum, "events" are semantically just log writes — every actual subscribe-and-react flow lives off-chain (indexers, relayers, bots). This means any "on-chain reaction triggered by an on-chain event" requires at least one off-chain intermediary, which adds trust assumptions and latency.

The primitives we already have:

- `call()` — synchronous, atomic, directed; the caller fully decides the callee
- `send()` — asynchronous, directed, cross-block delivery; point-to-point
- `defer transaction` — future block or explicit dispatch; delayed execution
- `timer` — system-scheduled time-based firing

What's missing is a primitive that is **multi-subscriber, fired synchronously inside the same tx, with subscriber failure isolated from the emitter** — the equivalent of EVM's `try { external.call(...) } catch { ... }` pattern.

### 1.2 Flagship Use Case: Pre-liquidation

A typical cascade in a DeFi lending protocol:

1. User A locks ETH as collateral, borrows stablecoin
2. An on-chain swap pushes ETH below A's liquidation threshold
3. Liquidation logic fires, A's collateral enters the liquidation flow
4. Liquidity providers B/C/D had previously subscribed to "A enters liquidation"
5. **B/C/D must get a reaction window inside the same swap tx, before liquidation executes** — otherwise a third-party liquidator front-runs them on the spread

This cannot be done natively on Ethereum: B/C/D have to run off-chain bots watching mempool / pending logs and compete via MEV. This is a clean differentiation we can claim: **subscription and reaction as a same-tx synchronous on-chain primitive.**

Other use cases in the same shape:

- Oracle price update → multiple dependent contracts re-evaluate state in the same tx
- DAO vote passes → multiple execution modules apply the result synchronously
- NFT mint → multiple marketplace/index contracts reflect inventory in the same tx

### 1.3 Design Principles

- **Same-tx, synchronous**: hooks run to completion inside the emit call stack; control returns to the emitter only after every subscriber has run
- **Failure isolation**: a single subscriber's failure (panic / OOG / revert) affects neither the emitter nor any other subscriber
- **Reuse, don't rebuild**: ride on top of existing cross-actor `call()`, PVM snapshot, the unified QMDB storage layer, and cycle/cell accounting
- **Don't disturb cross-block invariants**: propose/verify shared path, `tx_root` ↔ receipt 1:1 mapping, basefee feedback, admission gate, and lane isolation all remain untouched

## 2. Proposal

### 2.1 Core Abstraction

The protocol-level primitives:

```python
# emitter side
rt.emit_event(topic: bytes, payload: bytes) -> EmitResult
    # payload length is bounded by MAX_EVENT_PAYLOAD_BYTES (default 4096); overflow fails the call
    # payload bytes are billed 1 cell/byte against the emitter (same model as calldata)
    # EmitResult contains the in-block synchronous fire outcomes
    # plus the list of sub_ids overflowed to H+1
    # Ordering: descending by bid; top MAX_SYNC_FIRES_PER_TOPIC fire synchronously,
    # the rest are split into multiple system defer txs

rt.force_unsubscribe_event(sub_id: SubscriptionId) -> ()
    # Callable only by the emitter; used for eviction.
    # gas_remaining and occupied cells are both refunded to the subscriber
    # (the emitter neither pays nor receives anything).
    # bid has already been sunk and is NOT refunded (see §2.6).

# subscriber side
rt.subscribe_event(
    emitter: ActorAddr,
    topic: bytes,
    handler: str,
    gas_prepaid: u64,
    bid: u64 = 0,                        # bid amount that drives rank; 0 means pure first-come-first-served
                                         # (placed after every positive bid)
) -> SubscriptionId
    # Subscriber is debited four items at once:
    #   - SUBSCRIPTION_REGISTRATION_FEE  cycles  (write compute, NOT refunded)
    #   - delta cells                            (EventSub record + index entry growth;
    #                                              fully refunded on unsubscribe / reap)
    #   - gas_prepaid                    cycles  (fire prepay pool;
    #                                              residual refunded on unsubscribe)
    #   - bid                            cycles  (already sunk, NOT refunded;
    #                                              recorded in the subscription's bid field)

rt.update_bid(sub_id: SubscriptionId, additional_bid: u64) -> u64
    # Callable only by the subscriber. Adds to bid (cannot decrease). Returns the new cumulative bid.
    # Takes effect immediately by reinserting into the (emitter, topic) ordered index.
    # Note: for an async segment whose ordering was already locked by an emit in the current tx,
    #       update_bid does NOT affect that emit's fire order — the new bid only affects this
    #       subscription's rank in subsequent emits (see §2.3 "async segment ordering is locked").

rt.topup_subscription(sub_id: SubscriptionId, additional_gas: u64) -> u64
    # Any account may top up a subscription's gas_remaining. Returns the new balance.
    # Top-ups are non-refundable, do not change bid or REGISTRATION_FEE; used to keep
    # long-lived subscriptions alive before gas_remaining is drained.
    # The funder pays additional_gas cycles, which enter the subscription prepay pool.

rt.unsubscribe_event(sub_id: SubscriptionId) -> u64
    # Callable only by the subscriber. Returns the refunded gas_remaining.
    # Cells occupied by the subscription are also refunded;
    # SUBSCRIPTION_REGISTRATION_FEE and bid are NOT refunded.
```

Subscribers **prepay a gas budget** at registration time, stored in the subscription record (mirroring the timer pre-fund pattern), and may optionally attach a `bid` as a priority offer. When `emit_event` runs, the PVM host reads the subscription index in descending `bid` order:

- **Top `MAX_SYNC_FIRES_PER_TOPIC` (default 64)**: fire synchronously inside the emitter's call stack, each subscriber wrapped in a snapshot — failure rolls back the subscriber's state, preserves the emitter's, and proceeds to the next subscriber.
- **Rank K+1 and beyond**: automatically forked into a `defer transaction`, fired in the same bid order at block `H+1` (riding on the existing defer subsystem; no new execution channel).

This forms a **tiered same-tx synchronous + cross-block async execution model** — the total subscriber cap is raised to `MAX_SUBSCRIBERS_PER_TOPIC = 512`; bidders willing to pay win the synchronous reaction window (e.g. liquidation front-run), while everyone else still receives the notification via H+1 async fire.

There are **three exit paths**, treated differently:

| Path | Triggered by | cycles (`gas_remaining`) | bid | cells |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Subscriber-initiated `unsubscribe` | The subscriber | Fully refunded; `REGISTRATION_FEE` not refunded | **Not refunded (sunk)** | Fully refunded to subscriber |
| `gas_remaining` depleted (auto-expiry) | Protocol (lazy GC, see §2.3) | Nothing left to refund | Not refunded (already sunk) | Fully refunded to subscriber (not the reaper) |
| Emitter forced removal | The emitter contract | Fully refunded to subscriber; emitter receives no share | Not refunded; emitter receives no share | Fully refunded to subscriber; emitter receives no share |

**Core asymmetric design**: the cycles-class costs (`REGISTRATION_FEE` and `bid`) are sunk at the moment they are paid — the former suppresses register/unregister churn, the latter blocks the "buy a slot → immediately unsubscribe → free squat" attack; `gas_remaining` (the actual fire budget) is consumed as it is used and the residual is refundable; cells (storage) is recoverable occupation and is fully refunded to the subscriber on cleanup. The emitter pays no cells and receives no cycles under any path — `EventSub` / `EventSubIndex` live under their own prefix, fully decoupling subscription cost from the emitter, and `bid` flows into the burn pool rather than to the emitter (eliminating any way for the emitter to extract rent through the bidding market).

### 2.2 Data Model

#### Storage backbone

All chain state lives in a single QMDB instance under a unified 54-byte fixed-length key: `[1B prefix][20B address][33B slot]` (see `storage/src/state_key.rs`). Existing prefixes are allocated up to `0x13`; the next available is `0x14`.

The subscription registry must support two access paths:

1. **At emit time**: `(emitter, topic) → ordered list of subscribers` (drives fire order)
2. **At subscribe / unsubscribe / gas debit time**: `sub_id → single subscription record` (direct lookup, in-place updates to `gas_remaining`)

#### New StatePrefix values

Mirroring the existing `Timer`(`0x05`) + `TimerIndex`(`0x06`) two-prefix pattern, we add:

```
StatePrefix::EventSub      = 0x14    // Single subscription record (located by sub_id)
StatePrefix::EventSubIndex = 0x15    // (emitter, topic) → ordered subscriber index
```

**Subscription record** (located directly by `sub_id`):

```
key   = 0x14 || sub_id (33B)
value = ActorEventSubscription {
    emitter_addr:  Address,
    topic:         BoundedBytes<64>,
    subscriber:    Address,
    handler_name:  BoundedString,
    gas_prepaid:   u64,                  // Total prepaid budget at registration
    gas_remaining: u64,                  // Current balance; subscription expires when zero
    bid:           u64,                  // Cumulative bid (monotonically increasing via update_bid);
                                         // already sunk; drives rank
    sub_height:    BlockHeight,
}
```

**Subscription index** (one lookup yields all subscribers for `(emitter, topic)`, ordered for fire):

```
key   = 0x15 || keccak256(emitter_addr || topic)[..33]
value = Vec<(bid_inv: u64, sub_height: u64, sub_id: SubscriptionId)>
    // bid_inv = u64::MAX - bid, so high bid sorts first
    // Sort key: lexicographic (bid_inv, sub_height, sub_id)
    //   ⇒ higher bid wins; on tie, earlier subscription wins; tiebreak by sub_id
```

#### Design notes

- **Deterministic order**: the index value is sorted lexicographically by `(bid_inv, sub_height, sub_id)` — drives fire order, identical across nodes, no consensus divergence; the bidding market gets price-based rank while determinism is preserved
- **Bids take effect on write**: `update_bid` reinserts into the index immediately; subscribers can bump bid at any time to claim a higher rank, and all nodes observe the change synchronously
- **Bounded emit-path cost**: split into two layers (index + records) so a single index lookup doesn't drag along every full record; emit performs `1 index lookup → take top K → N record lookups`
- **Merkleization is free**: QMDB merkleizes everything under `0x14*` / `0x15*` automatically — the subscription state lands in `state_root` alongside `Code` / `Actor`
- **No emitter actor-storage quota consumption**: `ActorKvCount` / `ActorKvBytes` (`0x12` / `0x13`) only track KVs the emitter writes itself. Subscription records are protocol-level data and don't pollute user-contract quotas

### 2.3 Execution Model

Pseudo-code for `emit_event` at the PVM host layer:

```rust
fn emit_event(&mut self, topic: &[u8], payload: &[u8]) -> HostResult<EmitResult> {
    // 1. payload length + caps: per-tx emit count, per-tx total synchronous fire count, fan-out depth
    require!(payload.len() <= MAX_EVENT_PAYLOAD_BYTES);    // 4096 byte cap
    self.charge_emitter_cells(payload.len() as u64)?;      // 1 cell/byte against emitter
    self.check_emit_caps(topic)?;

    // 2. Load the subscription index (already sorted by (bid_inv, sub_height, sub_id))
    let sub_ids = self.load_sub_index(self.current_actor(), topic)?;

    // 3. Tier split: top K sync, rest queued async (ordering locked at this point)
    let k = MAX_SYNC_FIRES_PER_TOPIC.min(sub_ids.len());
    let (sync_subs, async_subs) = sub_ids.split_at(k);

    let mut sync_results = Vec::with_capacity(k);
    let mut deferred_subs = Vec::new();
    let mut zombies = Vec::new();

    // --- Sync segment: top K fire inside the emitter call stack ---
    for sid in sync_subs {
        let sub = self.load_sub_record(*sid)?;

        // 3a. Lazy GC: gas_remaining can't even cover one minimal fire, skip + mark zombie
        if sub.gas_remaining < MIN_FIRE_COST {
            zombies.push(*sid);
            sync_results.push(EmitOutcome::SkippedExpired(*sid));
            continue;
        }

        // 3b. Snapshot: subscriber state + global checkpoint
        let snapshot = self.pvm.snapshot();

        // 3c. Use sub.gas_remaining as this call's budget cap;
        //     consumed cycles/cells do NOT come out of the emitter's budget
        let r = self.call_actor_with_isolated_gas(
            sub.subscriber,
            &sub.handler_name,
            payload,
            sub.gas_remaining,
        );

        match r {
            Ok(res) => {
                self.deduct_subscription_budget(*sid, res.gas_used)?;
                sync_results.push(EmitOutcome::Ok(res));
            }
            Err(e) => {
                // 3d. On failure: rollback snapshot; emitter state untouched
                self.pvm.rollback(snapshot);
                self.deduct_subscription_budget(*sid, e.gas_consumed)?;
                sync_results.push(EmitOutcome::Err(e));
            }
        }
    }

    // --- Async segment: split overflow sub_ids into multiple system defer txs, all queued to H+1 ---
    //
    // **Ordering locked**: the ordering of async_subs is fixed at this emit (based on the current
    // (bid_inv, sub_height, sub_id) ordering at emit time). Even if a subscriber calls update_bid
    // between block H and block H+1 to raise its bid, the fire order of *this emit's* async
    // segment is not changed — the new bid only affects the rank for the *next* emit. This aligns
    // with the "decided at emit time" semantics of the sync segment, and rules out the
    // "emit-then-bump-bid to cut in line on the current async segment" arbitrage.
    //
    // **Split policy**: each system defer tx carries at most ASYNC_FIRES_PER_DEFER_TX = 64 subs.
    // 448 overflow subs split into ⌈448/64⌉ = 7 defer txs, all targeting H+1;
    // if H+1's total cycle budget cannot absorb them, the existing defer admission gate naturally
    // pushes the excess into H+2 / H+3.
    let emit_id = self.next_emit_id_in_tx();          // index of this emit within the tx; used in receipt causality
    for chunk in async_subs.chunks(ASYNC_FIRES_PER_DEFER_TX) {
        self.enqueue_event_defer_tx(EmitOrigin {
            emitter:      self.current_actor(),
            topic:        topic.to_vec(),
            payload:      payload.to_vec(),
            sub_ids:      chunk.to_vec(),
            origin_block: self.current_block(),
            origin_tx:    self.current_tx_hash(),
            emit_id,
        }, self.current_block() + ASYNC_FIRE_DEFERRAL_BLOCKS)?;
    }
    deferred_subs.extend_from_slice(async_subs);

    // --- Zombie cleanup: remove from index list and delete subscription records.
    //     Freed cells are credited back to each subscriber (NOT to emitter / reaper).
    if !zombies.is_empty() {
        self.trim_sub_index(self.current_actor(), topic, &zombies)?;
        for sid in &zombies {
            let sub = self.load_sub_record(*sid)?;
            self.credit_cells(sub.subscriber, self.compute_freed_cells(&sub))?;
            self.delete_sub_record(*sid)?;
        }
    }

    Ok(EmitResult {
        sync_outcomes: sync_results,
        deferred_subs,                  // caller can observe which sub_ids are queued to H+1
        emit_id,                        // index of this emit within the tx; for receipt correlation
    })
}
```

At block H+1 the async segment shares the same `call_actor_with_isolated_gas` + snapshot path as the sync segment; the only difference is that the entry point is a system defer tx, and each such tx produces an independent receipt carrying `triggered_by_emit = EmitOrigin {..}` — external light clients / indexers use this field to correlate H+1 async receipts back to the original H-block emit (see §3.2 for the receipt schema extension).

`unsubscribe_event` / `force_unsubscribe_event` share the following internal path:

```rust
fn remove_subscription(&mut self, sid: SubscriptionId, caller: Address) -> HostResult<u64> {
    let sub = self.load_sub_record(sid)?;

    // Authorization: subscriber (unsubscribe) or matching emitter (force_unsubscribe)
    require!(caller == sub.subscriber || caller == sub.emitter_addr);

    // 1. Refund residual gas (cycles) to the subscriber.
    //    REGISTRATION_FEE and bid were burned at subscribe / update_bid time;
    //    the sub.bid field is only a sort signal here, no further handling required.
    let cycles_refund = sub.gas_remaining;
    self.credit_balance(sub.subscriber, cycles_refund)?;

    // 2. Compute the storage delta freed by removing this record + index entry,
    //    and refund those cells to the subscriber regardless of who called us.
    let cells_freed = self.compute_freed_cells(&sub);
    self.credit_cells(sub.subscriber, cells_freed)?;

    self.trim_sub_index(sub.emitter_addr, &sub.topic, &[sid])?;
    self.delete_sub_record(sid)?;
    Ok(cycles_refund)
}
```

Bid handling inside `subscribe_event` and `update_bid`:

```rust
fn apply_bid(&mut self, subscriber: Address, sid: SubscriptionId, bid_delta: u64) -> HostResult<()> {
    require!(bid_delta > 0);                               // zero-delta calls are not allowed (no-op)
    self.debit_balance(subscriber, bid_delta)?;            // debit subscriber immediately
    self.burn_cycles(bid_delta)?;                          // route into burn pool (same channel as EIP-1559 basefee)
    self.bump_sub_bid(sid, bid_delta)?;                    // accumulate into sub.bid and reinsert into the index
    Ok(())
}
```

Key points:

- **Snapshot/rollback reuses the existing PVM mechanism** (`pvm/crates/vm/src/vm/snapshot.rs`) — not built from scratch
- **Gas isolation**: each subscriber executes within its own prepaid `gas_remaining` and never touches the emitter's cycles/cells. This is the precondition for failure isolation — otherwise a malicious subscriber could OOG the emitter's tx by burning emitter gas
- **`call()` reuse**: the underlying call path is the existing cross-actor call; no new execution subsystem
- **`defer` reuse**: the overflow segment rides directly on the existing `defer transaction` channel (see §3.2) — no "event async lane" or other new execution channel introduced
- **Deterministic order**: the subscription index is lexicographically ordered by `(bid_inv, sub_height, sub_id)` — every validator walks the sync segment in the same order, and the async segment is enqueued into the defer queue in the same order, ruling out consensus divergence
- **Bid never flows to emitter**: bid is burned immediately at subscribe / update_bid time; the `bid` field on the record is purely a sort signal — the emitter cannot collect any auction revenue, eliminating the attack surface where the emitter manipulates the subscription market for rent extraction
- **Lazy cleanup**: zombie subscriptions are auto-reaped when the next emit's sync segment encounters them, with no separate GC subsystem; async-segment zombies are likewise cleaned when the H+1 defer fires
- **Refund never flows to emitter**: whether `unsubscribe` or `force_unsubscribe`, the residual gas / cells always go back to the subscriber's account — preventing emitters from gaming "lure subscriber → force-remove → harvest"

### 2.4 Decorators and Explicit API (SDK)

The SDK offers **two** emit styles, both compiling down to the §2.1 `rt.emit_event` host API:

**Form A: `@emit` decorator (return-only, simple version)**

Fits "notify on function return" semantics — bound to return, at most one event per function call:

```python
@emit("liquidation_imminent")
def maybe_liquidate(self, position_id):
    if self.below_threshold(position_id):
        return ("trigger", position_id)              # decorator auto-emits ("liquidation_imminent", ...)
    return ("noop", None)                            # also emits, payload = ("noop", None)
```

**Form B: `ctx.emit` explicit API (anywhere, any number of times, any branch)**

Fits "procedural events" in complex business flows — fire at any point in the function body, inside branches, or repeatedly inside a loop:

```python
def settle_batch(self, ctx, orders):
    for order in orders:
        result = self.try_match(order)

        if result.matched:
            # Emit #1: successful match, fired inside a branch
            ctx.emit("order_matched", {"id": order.id, "price": result.price})
        elif result.expired:
            # Emit #2: expired, different topic
            ctx.emit("order_expired", {"id": order.id})
        # Neither matched nor expired → no event; the function continues

    # Emit #3: batch summary, coexisting with the N per-iteration emits above
    ctx.emit("batch_settled", {"count": len(orders)})
    return ("ok", len(orders))
```

`ctx.emit` calls `rt.emit_event` directly, so a single function can **emit an arbitrary number of events** (subject to the §2.5 `MAX_EMITS_PER_TX` total) and supports **arbitrary control flow**.

**Subscriber-side decorator** (including the `bid` parameter):

```python
@on_event(
    emitter="0xLENDING_PROTOCOL",
    topic="liquidation_imminent",
    gas=500_000,
    bid=100_000,                                     # bid 100k cycles to claim a sync-window slot
)
def on_liquidation(self, position_id):
    self.bid_for_collateral(position_id)
```

Decorators are SDK sugar — Form A, Form B, and the subscriber decorator all sit on top of the §2.1 host API. This means the host API and the decorator layer **can be released independently**: once the Phase 1/2 host API is in, business actors can write directly against `rt.emit_event` / `ctx.emit`, and decorators ship later as a Phase 3 DX iteration.

### 2.5 Protocol Constants

To prevent fan-out attacks and consensus divergence, the following must be defined as protocol constants and applied identically across validators:

| Constant | Suggested initial | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `MAX_SUBSCRIBERS_PER_TOPIC` | **512** | Max subscribers per (emitter, topic), counting sync + async segments together |
| `MAX_SYNC_FIRES_PER_TOPIC` | **64** (conservative launch value, governance-tunable; suggested ceiling **256**) | Cap on subscribers fired synchronously inside the emitter call stack per emit (top K by bid). Constrained by lane cycle budget, validator latency, and snapshot/rollback attack surface; see §6.4 and [ext_cip-29-sync-cap-analysis-en](./ext_cip-29-sync-cap-analysis-en.md) |
| `MAX_EMITS_PER_TX` | 16 | Max `emit_event` calls inside a single tx |
| `MAX_SYNC_FIRE_PER_TX` | 256 | Cap on total **synchronous** fires per tx (emits × sync_subs); async segment does not count |
| `MAX_EVENT_PAYLOAD_BYTES` | 4,096 | Per-emit payload byte cap; exceeding fails the emit; payload is billed 1 cell/byte against the emitter |
| `ASYNC_FIRES_PER_DEFER_TX` | 64 | Cap on async subs per system defer tx; overflow is split into multiple defer txs at this granularity; aligned with `MAX_SYNC_FIRES_PER_TOPIC` |
| `MAX_EVENT_DEPTH` | 4 | Emit nesting depth (a handler invoked by an emit emits another topic) — **independent from PVM `max_call_depth = 32`**: K sibling handlers serialize their snapshot/rollback rather than nesting, so they do not consume call-depth slots |
| `EMIT_SAME_TOPIC_REENTRY` | `false` | Same topic cannot be re-emitted inside its own emit call stack |
| `MIN_SUBSCRIPTION_GAS_PREPAID` | 50,000 cycles | Floor on prepaid budget (blocks dust subscriptions spamming the registry) |
| `SUBSCRIPTION_REGISTRATION_FEE` | 10,000 cycles | One-time write-compute charge at `subscribe`, **not refunded**; suppresses register/unregister churn |
| `SUBSCRIPTION_CELL_COST` | Per actual storage delta (typical ≈ 9 cells) | Charged at `subscribe` based on the actual `EventSub` record + index-entry growth; fully refunded to the subscriber on `unsubscribe` / reap |
| `MIN_BID` | 0 | Floor on bid — zero bids are allowed; zero-bid subs sort by `sub_height` time order, placed after every positive bid |
| `MIN_FIRE_COST` | 5,000 cycles | At emit time, subscriptions whose `gas_remaining` falls below this are skipped and marked for zombie cleanup |
| `ASYNC_FIRE_DEFERRAL_BLOCKS` | 1 | Block delay applied when forking overflow subscribers into a `defer transaction` (H+1) |

These mirror the existing `TimerConfig` pattern and are governance-tunable. **`MAX_SYNC_FIRES_PER_TOPIC = 64` is a deliberately conservative launch value**: under typical handler costs, it leaves the emitter ≥80% of its lane budget for its own logic; once testnet data on real handler-cost distributions is in, governance can raise the cap to 128 / 256 in steps (full analysis and the upgrade criteria are in §6.4 and [ext_cip-29-sync-cap-analysis-en](./ext_cip-29-sync-cap-analysis-en.md)). 256 is a hard practical ceiling — beyond that the emitter tx loses the ability to do anything else.

### 2.6 Bidding System Actor

A dedicated system actor handles the subscription-bidding market's query and write surface. **A separate address was chosen rather than co-locating under `0x09` (Governance)**: `0x09` already owns `SettlementConfig` and other governance duties, and bolting on the bidding market would bloat its responsibilities and conflict with the "system-level stable parameters" semantics of settlement — bidding is high-frequency user behavior and must stand alone.

```rust
EVENT_SUBSCRIPTION_SYSTEM_ACTOR = Address::from_low_u64(0x0A)
```

#### Endpoints

| Method | Type | Semantics |
|---|---|---|
| `get_rank(sub_id) -> u32` | read | Returns this subscription's current rank (0-indexed) **for future emits**; rank < `MAX_SYNC_FIRES_PER_TOPIC` means the **next** emit will fire it synchronously. **Note**: does not reflect async-fire positions already locked by an in-flight emit and queued to H+1 (see §2.3 "async segment ordering is locked") |
| `get_topic_orderbook(emitter, topic, limit) -> Vec<OrderbookEntry>` | read | Returns the top-`limit` `(sub_id, subscriber, bid)` tuples — the visible orderbook of the bidding market for the **next** emit |
| `get_min_bid_for_rank(emitter, topic, target_rank) -> u64` | read | Returns the minimum bid required to claim `target_rank` (= the current holder's bid + 1); subscribers price their bumps against this |
| `update_bid(sub_id, additional_bid) -> u64` | write | Callable only by the subscriber; adds to bid (cannot decrease), burns immediately and reinserts into the index; returns the new cumulative bid. **No effect on already-locked emits** — the new bid only affects **subsequent emits** |
| `topup_subscription(sub_id, additional_gas) -> u64` | write | Any account may top up a subscription's `gas_remaining`; returns the new balance |

`update_bid` is also exposed directly as a host API (see §2.1); calling it via the system actor is the SDK-friendly wrapper — the `@on_event` decorator's runtime-upgrade API also routes through this path.

#### Compatibility check with existing unsubscribe / force_unsubscribe

With bidding introduced, the three exit paths from §2.1 remain **fully compatible** — bid is burned immediately at subscribe / update_bid, the `bid` field on the record is purely a sort signal, and the exit paths require no special handling for bid:

| Path | Interaction with bid |
|---|---|
| Subscriber-initiated `unsubscribe` | bid already burned — not refunded; the subscriber's financial commitment is identical to the "pre-bidding" version |
| `gas_remaining` depleted (auto-expiry) | bid already burned — no action required; the reaper just cleans the index and the record |
| Emitter forced removal | bid already burned — the emitter gets no portion either; rules out "lure with high bid → forced eviction" arbitrage |

Potential conflict points flagged during review (**confirmed to be non-conflicts**):

- Index sort-key change (`(sub_height, sub_id)` → `(bid_inv, sub_height, sub_id)`): unsubscribe is still a single-point delete by `sub_id`, decoupled from how the index is ordered
- `update_bid` introduces "mid-flight rank changes": every validator reorders synchronously, determinism is preserved; subscribers can observe whether their rank has been pushed out of the sync window
- Unsubscribe timing: `unsubscribe` is callable at any rank, with no "must exit the bidding first" requirement — simplifies the user surface
- Already-locked async emits: `unsubscribe` is still a single-point delete by `sub_id`; an in-flight system defer tx hitting H+1 will see the `sub_id` is gone and skip that slot (same path as zombie cleanup) — `gas_remaining` and cells have already been refunded at `unsubscribe` and are not double-debited

#### User perception / participation

Subscribers have full observability into the bidding market:

1. Call `get_topic_orderbook` to see competitors' bids and ranks
2. Call `get_min_bid_for_rank(target_rank=63)` to see the threshold for entering the sync window
3. Call `update_bid` to outbid into the sync segment, or stay with a low bid and accept the async segment's H+1 timing
4. Call `get_rank` to monitor rank movement

This forms a complete secondary market for event subscriptions — bid, query, raise, observe are all programmable primitives composable inside actor code; business actors can wrap automated bidding strategies at the contract layer.

## 3. Why This Design Is Safe

Event hooks are a derivative of `call()` (same tx, synchronous, state-isolatable) — they are **not** a derivative of `send()` or `defer transaction`. The protocol risk surfaces are categorically different.

| Subsystem | Same-tx hook (sync segment) | Cross-block hook (async segment) |
|---|---|---|
| propose / verify shared path | **Unchanged** — hooks run inside the user-tx execution stack; propose/verify still complete in a single pass | **Unchanged** — H+1 system defer txs travel the same path as any other defer tx |
| `tx_root` ↔ receipt 1:1 mapping | **Unchanged** — sync fires are intra-tx cross-actor calls, they don't produce independent receipts | **Unchanged** — each system defer tx produces its own receipt, belonging to the H+1 block's `tx_root` |
| bridge / IBC inclusion proofs | **Unchanged** | **Lightly extended** — receipts gain a `triggered_by_emit` field marking cross-block causality (§3.2); the inclusion-proof structure is not affected |
| admission gate | **Unchanged** — every sync trigger lives inside a user tx that has already passed admission | **Unchanged** — system defer txs travel the same admission as any other defer tx; H+1 overflow naturally rolls forward |
| basefee feedback loop | **Unchanged** — hook gas comes from the subscriber prepaid pool, but **does count toward the current block's block-level cycle consumption** (CIP-3 §2.4), feeding the basefee loop | **Unchanged** — async-segment cycles count toward H+1 block consumption |
| Lane budgets (User / Runner / Timer / System) | Hook gas comes from the subscription prepay pool but consumes User-lane budget | System defer txs travel the System lane (same column as any defer tx) |

The only protocol-level additions are:

- §2.2 — the subscription registry (a new merkleized table)
- §2.3 — the emit / snapshot / rollback call semantics
- §2.5 — the protocol constants

All three are **storage + host API layer** changes. None of them touches cross-block invariants.

### 3.1 Reuse Map

| Existing mechanism | Role in this proposal |
|---|---|
| PVM `snapshot.rs` | Subscriber failure rollback (direct reuse) |
| Cross-actor `call()` | Underlying call path for hook fires (shared between sync and async segments) |
| Single-QMDB + StateKey encoding | The new `EventSub` / `EventSubIndex` prefixes plug straight into the existing QMDB (see §2.2) |
| Timer pre-fund pattern | Reference implementation for subscription gas prepay |
| Cycle / cell accounting | Hook execution accounting (drawn from the subscriber prepaid pool) |
| **`defer transaction` subsystem** | **Execution channel for async-segment (rank ≥ K) overflow subscribers — no "event async lane" added** |
| **EIP-1559 basefee burn channel** | **Sink for both `bid` and `REGISTRATION_FEE`; shares the basefee burn path so no new burn subsystem is needed** |

**No subsystem is built from scratch.**

### 3.2 Relationship to `defer transaction`

Event hooks (**sync segment**) and `defer transaction` remain parallel primitives, but **the async segment (rank ≥ `MAX_SYNC_FIRES_PER_TOPIC`) reuses `defer transaction` as its execution channel** — yielding a coordinated sync + async structure:

| Dimension | `defer transaction` (standalone use case) | event hook sync segment (rank < K) | event hook async segment (rank ≥ K) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Execution block | future block | current block, current tx | H+1 block (driven by `ASYNC_FIRE_DEFERRAL_BLOCKS`) |
| Trigger mechanism | height-triggered or explicit dispatch | inside the emit call stack | host auto-enqueues a system defer tx at emit time |
| Failure semantics | independent receipt, independent commit | snapshot rollback, no receipt | independent receipt (same as any defer tx) |
| Fit | user-scheduled async tasks, scheduled work | synchronous event subscription (e.g. liquidation front-run requires same tx) | notifications, analytics, slow-path alerts that tolerate 1-block latency |
| Billing source | scheduler | subscriber's `gas_remaining` | subscriber's `gas_remaining` |

**Impact on the existing `defer transaction` implementation**: a single new trigger source (the system defer tx enqueued from inside `emit_event`) is added; all other scheduling / admission / execution paths are **unchanged**. The system defer tx carries an `EmitOrigin` tuple:

```rust
struct EmitOrigin {
    emitter:      Address,
    topic:        BoundedBytes<64>,
    payload:      BoundedBytes<MAX_EVENT_PAYLOAD_BYTES>,
    sub_ids:      Vec<SubscriptionId>,         // ≤ ASYNC_FIRES_PER_DEFER_TX = 64
    origin_block: BlockHeight,                  // block of the original emit
    origin_tx:    H256,                         // tx hash of the original emit
    emit_id:      u32,                          // index of this emit within the tx (disambiguates multiple emits)
}
```

At block H+1 the protocol unpacks this, and each `sub_id` travels the same `call_actor_with_isolated_gas` + snapshot path as the sync segment.

**Receipt schema extension**: every receipt belonging to a system defer tx born from an emit's async segment must carry:

```rust
struct AsyncEmitReceipt {
    // ... general receipt fields (gas_used, events, status, ...) ...
    triggered_by_emit: Option<EmitOriginRef>,  // set only for system event defer txs; None for any other defer tx
}

struct EmitOriginRef {
    origin_block:  BlockHeight,
    origin_tx:     H256,
    emit_id:       u32,
}
```

External light clients / indexers use `triggered_by_emit` to correlate the H+1 async receipt back to the original H-block emit. **Key invariants**:

- `triggered_by_emit` is just a receipt field; it does not break the `tx_root` ↔ receipt 1:1 mapping
- The inclusion-proof structure is unchanged (an H+1 receipt still belongs to the H+1 block's `tx_root`)
- The correlation is one-way and observable (receipt → original emit); no back-pointer needs to live in the H-block `tx_root`

## 4. Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Mitigation |
|---|---|
| **Breadth fan-out attack**: a malicious emitter accumulates many subscribers → a single emit slows the tx dramatically | §2.5's `MAX_SYNC_FIRES_PER_TOPIC` + `MAX_SYNC_FIRE_PER_TX` double cap pins the sync-segment cost; the overflow segment rides defer and is throttled a second time by the admission gate |
| **Reentry loop**: a handler re-emits forming an A→B→A cycle | `MAX_EVENT_DEPTH = 4` + `EMIT_SAME_TOPIC_REENTRY = false` |
| **Subscription spam**: an attacker registers vast numbers of dust subscriptions to bloat an emitter's index list | `MIN_SUBSCRIPTION_GAS_PREPAID` floor (every subscription must carry a minimum prepay) + `MAX_SUBSCRIBERS_PER_TOPIC = 512` index-list cap; subscription records live under their own prefix and don't consume the emitter's actor-storage quota; **bidding naturally suppresses spam** — sync-segment slots are protected by bid ranking, and spam subscriptions can only land in the tail of the async segment with no impact on the head |
| **Unclear gas responsibility**: who pays for the registry traversal and snapshot overhead inside `emit_event`? | The emit call itself is metered as "registry read + N × snapshot" and charged to the emitter; per-subscriber fire cost is drawn from the subscriber's prepaid pool — the boundary is explicit |
| **Subscription order manipulation**: gaining fire priority through non-market means | Order is pinned to lexicographic `(bid_inv, sub_height, sub_id)`, publicly observable; subscribers gain sync-segment rank by bidding (same logic as an auction), and ties fall back to time order — a market-driven primary axis with a deterministic tiebreak |
| **Silent failure semantics** | `EmitResult` exposes per-subscriber outcomes for explicit emitter-side checks; the receipt's events field records every fire result (success / failure + gas) — observable and auditable |
| **Invisible subscription expiry** | The registry exposes a query API; subscribers can read their own `gas_remaining` and top up proactively |
| **register/unregister churn**: rapid `subscribe` + immediate `unsubscribe` to thrash storage | `SUBSCRIPTION_REGISTRATION_FEE` is charged at subscribe and not refunded on unsubscribe — the storage-write cost is collected up-front, so the more the attacker churns, the more they lose |
| **Emitter harvesting gas via forced removal** | `force_unsubscribe_event` hard-codes that both `gas_remaining` and freed cells go back to the subscriber; the emitter receives no portion of either |
| **Emitter forced to absorb subscriber cells → economic spam** | `EventSub` / `EventSubIndex` live under their own prefix and **never count against the emitter's `ActorKvCount` / `ActorKvBytes` quota**; cells are fully borne by the subscriber — the core advantage of a protocol-level primitive over an "emitter-built subscription table" approach |
| **Snap-buy rank → unsubscribe arbitrage**: an attacker bids high to claim a sync-window slot, then unsubscribes moments before the emit to claw back the money | bid is **burned immediately** at `subscribe` / `update_bid` (same channel as EIP-1559 basefee); the `bid` field on the record is purely a sort signal, and `unsubscribe` / `force_unsubscribe` always treat bid as non-refundable → snap-buy is a sunk cost, the arbitrage doesn't work |
| **Overflow subscribers silently delayed**: rank ≥ K subscribers fire one block later and don't know they fell into the async segment | (1) `EmitResult.deferred_subs` is observable to the emitter / caller during the sync segment; (2) `EVENT_SUBSCRIPTION_SYSTEM_ACTOR.get_rank(sub_id)` can be queried at any time; (3) subscribers can `update_bid` to climb back into the sync segment → falling behind is an **observable, intervenable** state, not an implicit failure |
| **Emitter manipulating the bidding market for rent**: emitter controls the subscription market to extract auction revenue | Bid flows directly into the burn pool — **the emitter gets no share**; the emitter has no `update_bid` privilege over subscribers → no auction revenue leaks out, no counterparty for the emitter to manipulate |
| **Bid inflation / cycle deflation imbalance**: heavy bidding burns excessive cycles and warps token economics | Bid uses the same burn channel as the EIP-1559 basefee and is captured by existing burn dashboards; governance can adjust `MIN_BID` and `update_bid`'s minimum step to dampen if needed |
| **Oversized payload attack**: emitter sends a 1MB payload so every sync sub receives a data copy, blowing the lane | `MAX_EVENT_PAYLOAD_BYTES = 4096` hard cap; oversize emits fail; payload is billed 1 cell/byte against the emitter, forcing the emitter to bear the propagation cost |
| **Post-emit bid bump to cut in line on the current async segment**: subscriber calls `update_bid` between emit and H+1 fire, hoping to leapfrog within the in-flight async segment | The async-segment ordering is locked at emit time (§2.3) — the new bid only affects subsequent emits; the current async segment's fire order is fixed and every validator executes in that locked order |
| **Async-segment OOM accumulation**: a single emit produces 448 overflow subs × N emits in the same block → an H+1 fire flood | The async segment is split into multiple defer txs at `ASYNC_FIRES_PER_DEFER_TX = 64`; whatever overflows the H+1 block budget naturally rolls forward to H+2 / H+3 via the existing defer admission gate — no new "event queue explosion" path is introduced |
| **Emit-call nesting depletes the stack**: handlers invoked inside an emit perform cross-actor calls, repeated nesting depletes the PVM call stack | `MAX_EVENT_DEPTH = 4` and PVM `max_call_depth = 32` are independent counters; K sibling handlers execute serially without nesting; worst case 4 × 8 = 32 still sits within the PVM bound |

## 5. Rollout Plan

### 5.1 Phased Delivery

| Phase | Deliverable | Effort | Validation |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Phase 0** — Pure SDK prototype | Actor library ships an `@hookable` decorator backed by existing `call()` + actor-side try/except, with a subscription table stored in the emitter's own actor storage | 1–2 weeks | Run a real liquidation flow against it; if business-side requirements are satisfied, Phase 1+ can be deferred or scoped down |
| **Phase 1** — Protocol-level subscription registry + `subscribe_event` host API | Global registry storage model, register/unregister host APIs, merkleized subscription records | 4–6 weeks | Testnet actors can register subscriptions; the registry is queryable from contract code |
| **Phase 2** — `emit_event` host API + snapshot/rollback integration | `emit_event` implementation, PVM snapshot + traversal, failure-isolation tests | 4–6 weeks | End-to-end: emitter → fire multiple subscribers → one subscriber fails without affecting the rest |
| **Phase 3** — SDK decorators + docs + sample app | Python `@emit` / `@on_event` decorators, liquidation demo, developer docs | 2–3 weeks | Decorator-based liquidation scenario runs end-to-end |

### 5.2 Why This Order

- **Phase 0 is the cheap probe.** Many event-subscription scenarios may already be expressible as "subscriber registers with emitter + emitter explicitly calls subscribers" entirely in SDK. Phase 0 establishes whether that's true at minimum cost — saving us from finishing Phase 1+ only to discover the protocol-level support wasn't load-bearing.
- **Phase 1 must precede Phase 2.** Without a registry, `emit` has nothing to read.
- **Phase 3 is DX sugar.** The decorator layer is purely SDK-level; the protocol works without it. Developers can use the host API directly while the decorator API iterates.

## 6. Open Decisions

The P0 items (must be settled before implementation starts) are already addressed in §2.1 / §2.3 / §2.5 / §2.6 / §3.2:

- Async-segment ordering locked at emit time (§2.3)
- Receipt causality via the `triggered_by_emit` field (§3.2)
- Defer-tx split via `ASYNC_FIRES_PER_DEFER_TX = 64` (§2.5)
- Payload cap `MAX_EVENT_PAYLOAD_BYTES = 4096`, billed 1 cell/byte to the emitter (§2.5)
- Independent depth counter: `MAX_EVENT_DEPTH` decoupled from PVM `max_call_depth` (§2.5)
- Gas top-up via `rt.topup_subscription` (§2.1)

The following still need to be aligned with stakeholders before implementation kicks off.

### 6.1 Initial Values for Protocol Constants

§2.5's caps need business validation:

- Does `MAX_SUBSCRIBERS_PER_TOPIC = 512` cover the expected "long-tail notifications + top-tier reaction-window" split?
- Does `MAX_SYNC_FIRE_PER_TX = 256` cover typical multi-event cascades?
- Is `MIN_SUBSCRIPTION_GAS_PREPAID = 50,000` too high or too low?
- Is `ASYNC_FIRE_DEFERRAL_BLOCKS = 1` reasonable (does the business side accept a 1-block async delay, or would they prefer a configurable longer delay to amortize H+1 pressure)?

Governance can retune these, but the launch values shape early developer experience.

### 6.2 Decorator Naming

`@emit` / `@on_event` are direct. Alternatives:

- `@event` / `@subscribe`
- `@publishes` / `@listens`
- Or a different shape that fits existing SDK conventions better

If you have a preference for the decorator surface, raise it before Phase 3 starts.

### 6.3 P1 / P2 / P3 Backlog

Each of the following must be decided before its corresponding Phase's spec is frozen. Short summaries below; detailed analysis lives in follow-up extension documents.

#### P1 (implementation-complexity impact)

| # | Topic | Lean |
|---|---|---|
| P1-A | `SubscriptionId` generation rule (counter / hash / random?) | Lean toward `keccak256(emitter ‖ subscriber ‖ topic ‖ sub_height)[..33]` — deterministic, collision-resistant, easy to cross-check between nodes |
| P1-B | `MIN_BID_STEP` (prevents 1-cycle micro-bump spam) + `MAX_CUMULATIVE_BID` (prevents u64 overflow) | Lean toward `MIN_BID_STEP = 1000`, `MAX_CUMULATIVE_BID = u64::MAX / 2` as a soft ceiling |
| P1-C | `force_unsubscribe_event` trigger constraints (may the emitter call it arbitrarily?) | Lean toward "arbitrary calls are legal but emitters can make on-chain commitments to restrain themselves" — via an optional `manifest`-level "promises not to force-evict" flag |
| P1-D | Handler function signature standard (`handler(payload)` vs `handler(emitter, topic, payload)`) | Lean toward the latter — lets a single handler serve multiple topics |
| P1-E | Emitter actor upgrade / redeployment semantics for existing subscriptions | Co-defined with CIP-1; initial lean is "upgrade preserves subscriptions and the new code takes effect; deleting the actor counts as `force_unsubscribe` against every subscription" |

#### P2 (economic model / DX)

| # | Topic | Lean |
|---|---|---|
| P2-A | Bid price-discovery continuity (preventing bidding-race spikes) | Defer to testnet observation in Phase 0 / Phase 1; may introduce a second-price auction or smooth via `MIN_BID_STEP` |
| P2-B | Economic calibration of `REGISTRATION_FEE = 10,000` cycles | Data-driven adjustment from testnet |
| P2-C | Phase 0 → Phase 1 data migration | Lean toward "no migration" — Phase 0 is the probe; when Phase 1 ships, every subscription re-registers |
| P2-D | Topic character rules (`MAX_TOPIC_BYTES`, UTF-8 requirement?) | Lean toward `MAX_TOPIC_BYTES = 64`, no UTF-8 requirement (binary topics allowed) |
| P2-E | `update_bid` batching across the same block (merge multiple bumps) | Lean toward "no batching, every call reorders immediately" — simple, observable; high-frequency reordering is naturally throttled by bid burn |

#### P3 (implementation / testing / cross-subsystem)

| # | Topic | Trigger window |
|---|---|---|
| P3-A | Snapshot subsystem "wide sibling" stress test | At Phase 2 kickoff |
| P3-B | CIP-3 basefee feedback coefficients under cap=128/256 | Before each Phase B/C upgrade |
| P3-C | Cross-topic MEV arbitrage modeling | After Phase 3 |

### 6.4 Fan-out Cap as a Design Boundary

`MAX_SYNC_FIRES_PER_TOPIC = 64` is **not a hardcoded physical ceiling; it is a conservative launch choice**. The full argument lives in [ext_cip-29-sync-cap-analysis-en](./ext_cip-29-sync-cap-analysis-en.md); the executive summary is here.

Estimating the cost of a single fully-loaded synchronous emit against the 22M-cycle User-lane budget:

| Item | Per call | × 64 subs |
|---|---|---|
| Index read | ~1K | 1K |
| `EventSub` record read | ~500 | 32K |
| snapshot creation | ~1K | 64K |
| Handler invocation overhead | ~5K | 320K |
| Handler business logic (typical) | ~50K | 3.2M |
| Gas-deduction write | ~500 | 32K |
| **Total** | | **~3.6M cycles** (≈ 16% of the lane) |

Lane occupancy at different caps:

| Sync cap | Loaded cycles | Lane share | Budget left for emitter | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 64 (launch) | 3.6M | 16% | 18.4M | Ample, conservative |
| 128 | 7.2M | 33% | 14.8M | Still leaves the emitter substantial room |
| 256 (suggested practical ceiling) | 14.3M | 65% | 7.7M | Tight but workable |
| 500 | 28M | **127%** | **−6M, the tx is guaranteed OOG** | Blows the protocol-level hard cap |

**500 directly exceeds the User lane's 22M cap under typical handler costs** — this is the protocol-level hard cap and cannot be crossed. 256 is the practical edge where "the emitter tx can still do other things"; beyond that, the primitive degenerates into "exists only to emit."

#### Sync segment vs defer segment: asymmetric marginal cost

| | +1 sub in sync segment | +1 sub in async segment (defer) |
|---|---|---|
| Whose budget | The emitter tx's own User lane (22M) | H+1's overall block budget |
| Validator latency | Serial execution on the propose/verify critical path | Independent tx, parallel with other user txs |
| Failure-blast surface | The emitter tx's snapshot/rollback chain | Independent receipt, no cross-impact |
| Basefee feedback | Pushes the current block's cycle feedback | Pushes H+1's feedback, distributed |

This is why "overflow → defer" works but "unbounded sync segment" does not — the two classes of subs are not equivalent.

#### Upgrade path (governance decision)

Once the conservative 64 launch is in, the cap can be raised in stages based on testnet data:

| Stage | Trigger | Target cap |
|---|---|---|
| Phase A (launch) | — | **64** |
| Phase B | Testnet average handler cycles < 30K, and propose/verify p99 latency overhead < 50ms | 128 |
| Phase C | Phase B stable for 1 month with no snapshot-subsystem edge cases | 256 (practical ceiling) |

**Why 256 is the stopping point**: any further raise pushes a single emit's lane share past 65%, the emitter loses meaningful capacity for other work in the same tx, propose/verify serial latency amplifies more than 8× relative to 64, and consensus latency becomes sensitive.

#### How the tiered model addresses "500+ subscribers"

Raising the sync cap directly is not viable, but §2.3's **tiered execution model** still serves the theoretical "500+ subscribers" scenarios:

- `MAX_SUBSCRIBERS_PER_TOPIC = 512` (total registration cap)
- `MAX_SYNC_FIRES_PER_TOPIC = 64` (arithmetic hard cap on the sync segment)
- Ranks 65–512 are auto-forked into a `defer transaction`, which fires through the same path at H+1
- Ordering is by descending bid — **those who can pay get the sync window (liquidation front-run), those who can't or don't care about timing accept a 1-block delay (notification)**, market-driven tiering

This lets the same event serve two business classes simultaneously:

| Business class | rank | Latency | Typical use case |
|---|---|---|---|
| Liquidation front-run / price-update racing | 0 – 63 | Same-tx synchronous | Must be same-tx; high bid required to enter |
| Notification / analytics / slow path | 64 – 511 | H+1 async | Tolerates 1-block latency; zero-bid acceptable |

#### Business-side escape valves still useful

Even with tiering, three business-side splitting strategies remain valuable:

**1. Topic bucketing**

Split one over-broad topic into multiple finer-grained topics; subscribers attach to the ones they care about:

- Don't: `emit("liquidation")` ← 8000 subscribers crammed into one topic will still pile up in the async segment even with tiering
- Do: `emit(f"liquidation:tier_{tier}")` by risk band, `emit(f"liquidation:asset_{asset}")` by collateral asset

Subscribers self-segment by business relevance; in most cases a single bucket has fewer than 64 subscribers and fires entirely in the sync segment.

**2. Relay pattern (multi-tier fan-out)**

The emitter registers 64 "relay actors" as synchronous subscribers; each relay then maintains its own 64 synchronous subscribers:

- Tier 1 (emitter → relays) is a synchronous emit, preserving same-tx semantics
- Tier 2 (relay → end subscribers) is also a synchronous emit
- Capacity: 64 × 64 = 4096 end subscribers, all reachable same-tx synchronously (still bounded by the lane cycle budget; pair with topic bucketing to keep handler-logic cost low)

**3. Opt-in async (zero or low bid)**

Subscribers that don't need same-tx reaction (notifications, analytics, slow-path alerts) can register with `bid=0` deliberately — they fall into the async segment naturally and don't contend with reaction-window racers.

#### Why protocol-level "expand the sync segment" paths are rejected

Several protocol-level alternatives were considered and all rejected:

| Approach | Reason for rejection |
|---|---|
| Auto-split a single emit across multiple blocks (including the sync segment) | Breaks "same-tx synchronous" semantics — the very reason this primitive exists. The tiered model only async-izes the overflow; the sync segment keeps same-tx semantics |
| Raise `MAX_SYNC_FIRES_PER_TOPIC` to 500+ | Under typical handler costs this blows past the User lane's 22M cap (500 × 56K = 28M); even with ultra-cheap handlers, a single emit consumes a quarter of the block's cycle target and basefee swings hard; validator serial-fire latency physically amplifies 8× |
| Single-emit adaptive cap (dynamically split sync/async by total `gas_remaining`) | Subscribers can't predict whether they'll fire synchronously; consensus complexity grows; malicious subscribers can register dust `gas_remaining` to crowd into the sync segment |
| Index sharding (shard by hash) | 64 subs × 49 bytes ≈ 3.1 KB single blob — QMDB handles this trivially; sharding adds complexity to a non-problem |
| Round-robin sync fire (different batch of 64 per block) | Breaks the "high bid guarantees sync" contract — subscribers cannot rely on this primitive to lock the liquidation reaction window |
