<Note>
  **Status:** Draft
  **Type:** Standards Track
  **Category:** Core
  **Created:** 2026-01-18
  **Requires:** CIP-20, CIP-21
</Note>

## Abstract

CIP-22 defines **Continuous Clearing Auctions (CCAs)** for Cowboy, a fair price discovery mechanism for token launches that eliminates sniping, timing games, and information asymmetry. Tokens are released gradually over time, with each block settling at a uniform clearing price. Upon auction completion, proceeds automatically seed a CIP-21 liquidity pool.

This design is inspired by [Uniswap's CCA mechanism](https://blog.uniswap.org/continuous-clearing-auctions), adapted for Cowboy's actor model with native timer integration for gas-efficient per-block clearing.

Key features:
- **Gradual price discovery**: Tokens released per-block according to a schedule
- **Uniform pricing**: All bidders in a block pay the same clearing price
- **Anti-sniping**: Early bidders achieve better average prices
- **Automatic liquidity**: Auction proceeds seed a V2 or V3 pool
- **Composable**: Validation hooks for KYC, geographic restrictions, etc.

## Motivation

### The Token Launch Problem

Traditional token launches suffer from well-known issues:

| Method | Problem |
|--------|---------|
| **Fixed-price sale** | Underpricing leaves value on table; overpricing fails |
| **Dutch auction** | Sniping at the last moment; poor price discovery |
| **Batch auction** | All-or-nothing; no gradual discovery |
| **AMM launch** | Bots front-run; massive volatility; MEV extraction |

These mechanisms create timing games where sophisticated actors extract value from regular participants.

### How CCAs Solve This

CCAs distribute tokens over time through continuous clearing:

1. **No sniping advantage**: Supply is released every block; last-minute bids get no special treatment
2. **Early bidder advantage**: Bids placed earlier fill across more blocks at (likely) lower average prices
3. **Uniform block pricing**: All bidders in a block pay the same price—no information asymmetry
4. **Gradual convergence**: Market has time to discover fair value

### Why CCAs on Cowboy?

Continuous Clearing Auctions require per-block processing—releasing tokens, sorting bids, calculating clearing prices. On Ethereum, this creates a **keeper dependency**: someone must submit a transaction each block to trigger clearing, paying gas and creating MEV opportunities.

#### The Keeper Problem on Ethereum

| Approach | Problem |
|----------|---------|
| **External keeper/bot** | Someone must pay gas; dependency on altruistic/MEV actors |
| **Lazy clearing on user action** | Clearing delayed until next bid; stale prices |
| **Bundled into user txs** | Users pay extra gas for clearing; unfair cost distribution |
| **Flashbots/MEV searchers** | Works but adds MEV middlemen; centralization risk |

Over a 7-day auction (~100,800 blocks), someone must pay for ~100,800 clearing transactions.

#### Cowboy's Timer Advantage

Cowboy's native timers (CIP-1/CIP-5) eliminate the keeper problem entirely:

| Aspect | Ethereum CCA | Cowboy CCA |
|--------|--------------|------------|
| **Clearing trigger** | External tx required | Native timer, automatic |
| **Cost** | ~50k gas per block (paid by someone) | Timer lane, no extra user cost |
| **Reliability** | Depends on keepers showing up | Guaranteed by protocol |
| **Missed blocks** | Possible if gas too high | Impossible (timer always fires) |
| **MEV surface** | Keeper selection is MEV opportunity | Deterministic execution |
| **Finalization** | Separate tx to seed LP | Atomic via timer callback |

#### Specific Benefits

1. **Zero Keeper Infrastructure**: No bots, no keeper networks, no gas subsidies. The auction actor schedules a timer once at creation; the protocol handles the rest.

2. **Guaranteed Execution**: Cowboy reserves 20% of block capacity for timers. Even during extreme congestion, clearing executes. No "clearing got delayed because gas was too high."

3. **True Per-Block Clearing**: On Ethereum, if no one calls the clear function, clearing is deferred and bids see stale prices. Cowboy timers guarantee actual per-block clearing for smoother price discovery.

4. **Lower Total Cost**: Users only pay for their bid transactions. Clearing is "free" (uses reserved timer capacity, not user-paid gas).

5. **Atomic Graduation**: When the auction ends, a single timer callback checks the minimum raise, seeds the LP pool, and enables claims—all atomically, no separate finalization transaction.

6. **Reduced MEV Surface**: Timer execution is deterministic and protocol-ordered. No competition over "who gets to call clear," no sandwich opportunities around the clearing transaction.

This makes CCAs a natural fit for Cowboy—the mechanism works as designed without the infrastructure overhead required on keeper-dependent chains.

### Clearing Mechanism

The core innovation of CCAs is per-block clearing. Each block:

1. **Release tokens** according to schedule
2. **Sort active bids** by max_price (descending)
3. **Fill bids** from highest to lowest until supply exhausted
4. **Set clearing price** to the marginal bid's max_price
5. **Pro-rata fill** any bids at exactly the clearing price

#### Clearing Algorithm

```python
def clear_block(self):
    """Called by timer each block during auction."""

    if block.height < self.config.start_block:
        return
    if block.height > self.config.end_block:
        self._finalize_auction()
        return

    # 1. Calculate tokens to release this block
    tokens_to_release = self._get_release_amount(block.height)
    self.state.tokens_released += tokens_to_release

    # 2. Get active demand at or above floor
    active_bids = self._get_active_bids_sorted()  # Sorted by max_price DESC

    if len(active_bids) == 0:
        # No demand: price stays at floor, tokens accumulate
        self.state.current_clearing_price = self.config.floor_price
        return

    # 3. Calculate clearing price and fills
    tokens_remaining = tokens_to_release
    clearing_price = self.config.floor_price
    fills = []

    for price_tier, bids_at_tier in active_bids.items():
        if tokens_remaining == 0:
            break

        # Calculate demand at this price tier
        demand_at_tier = sum(
            self._remaining_demand(bid, price_tier)
            for bid in bids_at_tier
        )

        # How many tokens can be sold at this tier?
        tokens_at_tier = min(tokens_remaining, demand_at_tier)

        if tokens_at_tier == demand_at_tier:
            # Fully fill all bids at this tier
            for bid in bids_at_tier:
                fill_amount = self._remaining_demand(bid, price_tier)
                fills.append((bid, fill_amount, price_tier))
            tokens_remaining -= tokens_at_tier
        else:
            # Pro-rata fill at this tier (marginal price)
            clearing_price = price_tier
            for bid in bids_at_tier:
                bid_demand = self._remaining_demand(bid, price_tier)
                pro_rata_share = bid_demand * tokens_at_tier // demand_at_tier
                fills.append((bid, pro_rata_share, price_tier))
            tokens_remaining = 0
            break

        clearing_price = price_tier

    # 4. Execute fills
    for (bid, token_amount, price) in fills:
        currency_cost = token_amount * price // Q96
        bid.currency_spent += currency_cost
        bid.tokens_received += token_amount
        self.state.tokens_sold += token_amount
        self.state.currency_raised += currency_cost

    # 5. Update state
    self.state.current_clearing_price = clearing_price
    self.state.current_block = block.height

    # 6. Checkpoint for pro-rata claims
    self.state.checkpoints.append(Checkpoint(
        block=block.height,
        clearing_price=clearing_price,
        currency_raised_cumulative=self.state.currency_raised,
        tokens_sold_cumulative=self.state.tokens_sold
    ))

    emit_event("BlockCleared", {
        "block": block.height,
        "tokens_released": tokens_to_release,
        "tokens_sold": sum(f[1] for f in fills),
        "clearing_price": clearing_price,
        "currency_raised": self.state.currency_raised
    })
```

#### Remaining Demand Calculation

```python
def _remaining_demand(self, bid: Bid, price: u256) -> u256:
    """
    Calculate how many tokens a bid can still purchase at given price.

    The bid's budget is spread across remaining blocks.
    """
    if bid.max_price < price:
        return 0  # Bid is out of range

    remaining_currency = bid.currency_amount - bid.currency_spent
    remaining_blocks = self.config.end_block - block.height

    # Currency available this block (spread evenly)
    currency_this_block = remaining_currency // remaining_blocks

    # Convert to token demand at this price
    token_demand = currency_this_block * Q96 // price

    return token_demand
```

---

### Release Schedules

The release schedule controls how tokens are distributed over time. Common patterns:

#### Constant Release

```python
# Release 1M tokens over 1000 blocks = 1000 tokens/block
release_schedule = [
    ReleaseStep(rate_mps=1_000_000, duration_blocks=1000)
]
```

#### Front-loaded (Faster Start)

```python
# Higher release early, tapering off
release_schedule = [
    ReleaseStep(rate_mps=2_000_000, duration_blocks=250),   # 2x first quarter
    ReleaseStep(rate_mps=1_000_000, duration_blocks=500),   # Normal middle
    ReleaseStep(rate_mps=500_000, duration_blocks=250),     # 0.5x final quarter
]
```

#### Back-loaded (Slower Start)

```python
# Lower release early, accelerating
release_schedule = [
    ReleaseStep(rate_mps=500_000, duration_blocks=250),
    ReleaseStep(rate_mps=1_000_000, duration_blocks=500),
    ReleaseStep(rate_mps=2_000_000, duration_blocks=250),
]
```

### Graduation and Liquidity Seeding

When the auction ends successfully:

```python
def _finalize_auction(self):
    """Called after end_block."""

    if self.state.currency_raised < self.config.min_currency_raised:
        # Failed: refund everyone
        self.state.status = AuctionStatus.FAILED
        emit_event("AuctionFailed", {
            "currency_raised": self.state.currency_raised,
            "min_required": self.config.min_currency_raised
        })
        return

    # Success: seed liquidity pool
    self.state.status = AuctionStatus.GRADUATED

    final_price = self.state.current_clearing_price
    unsold_tokens = self.state.tokens_released - self.state.tokens_sold
    currency_for_lp = self.state.currency_raised
    tokens_for_lp = unsold_tokens  # Or could be a configured portion

    if self.config.pool_type == PoolType.V2_FULL_RANGE:
        # Seed V2 pool
        pool = Factory.get_or_create_v2_pool(
            self.config.token_id,
            self.config.currency_id,
            self.config.pool_fee_bps
        )

        Token.approve(self.config.token_id, pool.address, tokens_for_lp)
        Token.approve(self.config.currency_id, pool.address, currency_for_lp)

        (amount_a, amount_b, lp_tokens) = pool.add_liquidity(
            tokens_for_lp,
            currency_for_lp,
            0, 0,  # No slippage check (we control the price)
            self.config.lp_recipient
        )

    elif self.config.pool_type == PoolType.V3_CONCENTRATED:
        # Seed V3 pool with concentrated position around final price
        pool = Factory.get_or_create_v3_pool(
            self.config.token_id,
            self.config.currency_id,
            self.config.pool_fee_bps,
            tick_spacing=60
        )

        # Full range position
        tick_lower = -887220  # MIN_TICK
        tick_upper = 887220   # MAX_TICK

        position_id = pool.mint_position(
            tick_lower,
            tick_upper,
            tokens_for_lp,
            self.config.lp_recipient
        )

    emit_event("AuctionGraduated", {
        "final_price": final_price,
        "currency_raised": self.state.currency_raised,
        "tokens_sold": self.state.tokens_sold,
        "pool": pool.address,
        "lp_recipient": self.config.lp_recipient
    })
```

### Validation Hooks

CCAs support validation hooks for compliance:

```python
class ICCAHook:
    """Validation hook interface for CCAs"""

    def can_bid(
        self,
        auction: address,
        bidder: address,
        currency_amount: u256,
        max_price: u256
    ) -> bool:
        """
        Called before accepting a bid.

        Use for: KYC verification, geographic restrictions,
                 accredited investor checks, bid limits.
        """

    def on_bid(
        self,
        auction: address,
        bidder: address,
        bid_id: u256,
        currency_amount: u256,
        max_price: u256
    ) -> None:
        """Called after bid is placed. For analytics."""

    def can_claim(
        self,
        auction: address,
        bidder: address,
        bid_id: u256
    ) -> bool:
        """Called before allowing claim. For vesting, lockups."""
```

#### Example: KYC Hook

```python
class KYCAuctionHook(Actor):
    """Only verified users can bid"""

    def init(self, kyc_registry: address):
        self.kyc_registry = kyc_registry

    def can_bid(self, auction, bidder, currency_amount, max_price) -> bool:
        return KYCRegistry(self.kyc_registry).is_verified(bidder)

    def on_bid(self, auction, bidder, bid_id, currency_amount, max_price):
        emit_event("KYCBidPlaced", {"bidder": bidder, "bid_id": bid_id})

    def can_claim(self, auction, bidder, bid_id) -> bool:
        # Always allow claim (can't trap funds)
        return True
```

#### Example: Geographic Restriction Hook

```python
class GeoRestrictedHook(Actor):
    """Block certain jurisdictions"""

    def init(self, blocked_countries: list[str], attestation_registry: address):
        self.blocked_countries = set(blocked_countries)
        self.attestation_registry = attestation_registry

    def can_bid(self, auction, bidder, currency_amount, max_price) -> bool:
        attestation = AttestationRegistry(self.attestation_registry).get(bidder)
        if attestation is None:
            return False
        return attestation.country not in self.blocked_countries
```

### Timer Integration

> **Same-Block Constraint (CIP-5):** Timers created in the current block cannot fire in the same block. An auction with `interval=1` will have its first clearing delayed by one block.

Cowboy's native timers enable automatic per-block clearing:

```python
class ContinuousClearingAuction(Actor):
    """CCA implementation with timer-based clearing"""

    def init(self, config: AuctionConfig):
        self.config = config
        self.state = AuctionState(...)

        # Schedule clearing timer for each block during auction
        self.schedule_timer(
            trigger_type="height",
            start_height=config.start_block,
            interval=1,  # Every block
            end_height=config.end_block + 1,
            handler="clear_block"

## Security Considerations

### Price Manipulation

- **TWAP resistance**: Clearing price is demand-weighted, not spot-manipulable
- **No flash loans**: Bids are non-withdrawable while in range
- **Gradual discovery**: Manipulation must be sustained across many blocks

### Bid Griefing

- **Out-of-range withdrawal**: Bids below clearing price can always be withdrawn
- **No trapped funds**: Failed auctions refund all currency
- **Gas-efficient claims**: Batch claiming supported

### Hook Security

- **Hooks capped at 50,000 Cycles and 50,000 Cells** (same as CIP-20/CIP-21)
- **can_claim must return true** for funds to be claimable (hooks should not trap funds)
- **Timelock recommended** for hook updates

### Integer Precision

- **Q96 format** for prices (matches Uniswap V3)
- **Pro-rata rounding**: Rounds down (conservative for users)
- **Overflow checks**: Max supply capped at 1e30 wei

## Rationale

### Why Not Dutch Auction?

Dutch auctions suffer from:
- **Sniping**: Everyone waits for the last moment
- **Winner's curse**: Early bidders overpay
- **All-or-nothing**: Single clearing moment

CCAs distribute over time, rewarding early participation.

### Why Not Batch Auction?

Batch auctions are good but:
- **Single clearing**: No gradual discovery
- **Timing games**: Coordinate around deadline
- **Less information**: Market can't observe demand curve

CCAs reveal demand continuously.

### Why Timer-Based Clearing?

Cowboy's native timers enable:
- **No keeper costs**: Clearing is automatic
- **Deterministic execution**: Same result on all nodes
- **Gas efficiency**: Timer execution uses reserved block capacity

## Example: Token Launch

```python
from cowboy_sdk import Token, CCAFactory

# 1. Create token
my_token = Token.create(
    name="My Protocol Token",
    symbol="MPT",
    decimals=18,
    initial_supply=100_000_000 * 10**18  # 100M tokens
)

# 2. Configure auction (sell 50% of supply)
auction_supply = 50_000_000 * 10**18

release_schedule = [
    # Constant release over 7 days (~605k blocks at 1s)
    ReleaseStep(rate_mps=500_000, duration_blocks=604_800)
]

# 3. Create auction
auction = CCAFactory.create_auction(
    token_id=my_token,
    currency_id=USDC,
    total_supply=auction_supply,
    floor_price=to_q96(0.10),  # $0.10 floor
    start_block=block.height + 100,  # Start in ~10 minutes
    end_block=block.height + 100 + 100_800,  # 7 days
    release_schedule=release_schedule,
    min_currency_raised=1_000_000 * 10**6,  # $1M minimum
    pool_type=PoolType.V2_FULL_RANGE,
    pool_fee_bps=30,  # 0.30% fee
    lp_recipient=TREASURY,
    metadata_uri="ipfs://..."
)

# 4. Transfer tokens to auction
Token.transfer(my_token, auction.address, auction_supply)
```
